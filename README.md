# Scrape Tool (Once the scraping was completed in 2019)

"This program, named 'KensakuDownloader.py,' is designed to scrape content
from the website 'ken-saku.jp/company_profile.php' with a range of IDs 
from '2.html' to '160000.html.' The website hosts various company pages labeled sequentially,
such as '2.html,' '3.html,' '4.html,' and so on up to '100000.html' and beyond.

Once the scraping is complete, the extracted content from the selected HTML 
pages will be converted into a CSV format using another program called 'Kensaku2CSV.py.' 
This conversion process will capture essential information such as Name, Address,
Telephone (TEL), Fax (FAX), Website (Web), Email (Mail), and Comment from each company profile.
These details will be organized into separate rows within the CSV file."
